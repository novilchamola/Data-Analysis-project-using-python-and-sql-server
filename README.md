This dataset includes global mart sales data for 2022 and 2023. We cleaned and analyzed the data using Python in Jupyter Notebook, removing unnecessary columns, changing data types, and adding relevant columns for our analysis. After that, we connected to SQL Server to answer some business questions by writing SQL queries. This project demonstrates our skills in data analysis using Python and SQL.
